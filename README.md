## Disclaimer

This tool is an unofficial interface for retrieving publicly available Skeb artist information.

## API endpoints
- User info: `/api/users/<username>`
- All works (creator): `/api/users/<username>/works?role=creator`
- All sent requests (client): `/api/users/<username>/works?role=client`
    - When data volume is too large (exceeds 1200), pagination is required; use `meta.next` from the response as the URL for the next request.

## Deployment

Deploy your own instance to avoid rate limits and for personal use.

### Cloudflare Workers
1. Host HTML files (`index.html`, `wishlist.html`) on a static hosting service (e.g., GitHub Pages, Cloudflare Pages).
2. Create and deploy a Cloudflare Worker (using the `wrangler` CLI or Cloudflare dashboard).
3. Add environment variable:
   - `PAGE_URL`: URL of the hosted HTML files (e.g., `https://<username>.github.io/skeb-info/` for GitHub Pages).  
   - Note: Change `PAGE_URL` in `wrangler.toml`.

### Vercel
- Choose other frameworks and use the default settings for deployment. Includes both API and frontend.

## Limitations

- Rate limit: 100 User info requests per minute, 5 works requests per minute. Requests may fail if data volume is too large.
- Skeb API may be rate limited or unavailable due to changes in fields.
